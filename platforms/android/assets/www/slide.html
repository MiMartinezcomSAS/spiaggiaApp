                    You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed
                    the
                    world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I
                    don't
                    know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and
                    only
                    five
                    made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that
                    killed
                    the
                    other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

                    Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most
                    popular
                    gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes
                    with
                    it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

                    Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my
                    name
                    printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside
                    on a
                    mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a
                    toy
                    store.
                    And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
